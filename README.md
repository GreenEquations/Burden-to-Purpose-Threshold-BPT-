**Domain:** Human Collapse Psychology · Symbolic Systems  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Peer Review Ready · Public Experiment Invited

---

## Summary

The Burden-to-Purpose Threshold (BPT) theorem proposes that collapse in human or symbolic systems does not result from absolute stress alone, but from a relative failure of meaning to carry that stress. When subjective burden exceeds perceived purpose for longer than a critical threshold, collapse occurs.

---

## Formal Statement

Let:

- \( C(t) \): Internal contradiction over time  
- \( B(t) \): Subjective burden (emotional/psychological load)  
- \( P(t) \): Perceived purpose (coherence, meaning)  
- \( \theta \): Collapse latency threshold (time before structural failure)  

**Collapse Condition:**

$$
\exists t > \theta \; \text{such that} \; B(t) > P(t) \Rightarrow \text{Collapse}(C)
$$

---

## Collapse Dynamics

- Contradiction is sustainable only while \( P(t) > B(t) \)  
- Once \( B(t) > P(t) \) persists longer than \( \theta \), collapse is abrupt  
- Collapse is nonlinear — more like a tipping point than a gradual decline  
- Observable forms include burnout, resignation, ideological shift, or total disengagement

---

## Applications

- Psychological collapse and burnout (e.g., educators, medics, activists)  
- Symbolic agent stability under contradiction  
- Narrative failure in AI systems  
- Institutional trust collapse (when P(t) ≈ legitimacy perception)

## Empirical Testing Framework

### Human Subject Testing

- Instruments: Purpose-in-Life scale (PIL), PHQ-9, NASA-TLX  
- Population: High-stress fields (healthcare, education, military)  
- Metric: Time-series of P(t), B(t) to estimate \( \theta \)

### Symbolic Agent Simulation

- Define agents with contradiction function \( C(t) \)  
- Simulate varying \( B(t) \), \( P(t) \)  
- Inject meaning loss or moral strain  
- Measure latency and collapse behavior

## Predictive Outcomes

| Prediction                                | Observable Evidence                    |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Collapse precedes high burden            | P(t) drop is more predictive than B(t) |
| Narrative reinforcement extends \( \theta \) | Systems last longer with meaning injection |
| Collapse curve is nonlinear              | Sudden drop post-threshold             |
| Social buffers modulate P(t), B(t)       | Community raises purpose, reduces burden |

---

## Limitations

- Purpose and burden are proxy-based (subjective/self-reported)  
- \( \theta \) must be inferred indirectly from system latency  
- Cultural or institutional dynamics not yet formalized in this model  
- Economic or external buffer layers not modeled in this version

|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Existential Psychology | Frankl: “Meaning buffers suffering”      |
| Cybernetics            | Collapse = loss of dynamic stability     |
| Burnout Theory         | Adds symbolic and narrative perspective  |
| Collapse Theory        | Applies to identity and ideological systems |
| Cognitive Science      | Links contradiction to motivational loss |

## Conclusion

The BPT theorem reframes collapse as a failure of sustained meaning rather than a breakdown of resilience.  
Meaning acts as a structural buffer — when it erodes, systems give way.

> Purpose — not stamina — is the critical variable in collapse resilience.
