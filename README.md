## Summary

The **Burden-to-Purpose Threshold (BPT)** theorem models collapse not as the result of excessive stress, but as the result of insufficient perceived purpose. A system collapses when subjective burden exceeds perceived purpose for longer than a critical latency threshold.

---

## Theorem Statement

**Let**:
- `C(t)`: Internal contradiction
- `B(t)`: Subjective burden
- `P(t)`: Perceived purpose
- `θ`: Collapse latency threshold

**Collapse condition**:

> If there exists a time `t > θ` such that `B(t) > P(t)`, then collapse occurs:  
> `B(t) > P(t)` for `t > θ` ⇒ `Collapse(C) = True`

## Core Definitions

| Symbol       | Meaning                                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `C(t)`       | Internal contradiction (e.g., moral or logical strain) |
| `B(t)`       | Subjective burden (emotional or psychological load)    |
| `P(t)`       | Perceived purpose or meaning                           |
| `θ`          | Collapse latency threshold                             |
| `Collapse(C)`| System failure (burnout, shutdown, inversion)          |

## Collapse Dynamics

- The system remains stable while `P(t) > B(t)`
- If `B(t) > P(t)` persists beyond threshold `θ`, collapse occurs
- Collapse is nonlinear — often sudden or tipping-point in nature

## Empirical Framework

### A. Human Testing

- Metrics: Purpose-in-Life (PIL), PHQ-9, NASA-TLX
- Populations: Educators, healthcare workers, military, high-stress professions
- Method: Track burden and purpose over time; identify collapse points

### B. Symbolic Agent Simulation

- Agents modeled with evolving `C(t)`, `B(t)`, and `P(t)`
- Narrative memory and contradiction injected during stress events
- Measure collapse latency and response to reinforcement

## Predictions

| Prediction                             | Observable Outcome                       |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Meaning loss precedes burnout          | Decrease in `P(t)` before performance drop |
| Purpose reinforcement delays collapse  | Higher `P(t)` raises `θ`                   |
| Collapse is nonlinear past threshold   | Sudden resignation, disengagement         |
| Social input modulates `P(t)` and `B(t)` | Support raises `P(t)`, stress raises `B(t)` |

## Limitations

- `P(t)` and `B(t)` often rely on proxies or self-report
- `θ` is individualized and must be inferred statistically
- Collective/systemic collapse not fully modeled
- Does not currently account for economic or ecological stressors

---

## Suggested Visual Models

- Time plots of `P(t)`, `B(t)`, and `C(t)` over agent lifespan
- Collapse envelope models under stress vs. reinforcement
- Comparative simulations: high-θ vs. low-θ systems

## Conclusion

The **BPT theorem** reframes collapse as a rational system failure triggered by prolonged imbalance between burden and meaning. Purpose, not capacity, governs resilience.
