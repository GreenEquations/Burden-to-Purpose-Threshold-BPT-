##  Summary

The **Burden-to-Purpose Threshold (BPT)** theorem proposes that system collapse occurs not due to high stress, but due to insufficient meaning to sustain it. If **subjective burden** exceeds **perceived purpose** for longer than a critical duration, the system undergoes failure.

---

##  Formal Theorem Statement

Let:

- \( C(t) \): Internal contradiction
- \( B(t) \): Subjective burden
- \( P(t) \): Perceived purpose
- \( \theta \): Collapse latency threshold

**Collapse condition**:

\[
\exists t > \theta \quad \text{such that} \quad B(t) > P(t) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Collapse}(C)
\]

##  Definitions

| Symbol         | Meaning                                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| \( C(t) \)     | Internal contradiction (e.g., moral or logical strain) |
| \( B(t) \)     | Subjective burden (emotional/psychological load)       |
| \( P(t) \)     | Perceived purpose or meaning                           |
| \( \theta \)   | Time threshold before collapse                         |
| Collapse\(C\)  | System failure: burnout, shutdown, inversion           |

##  Collapse Dynamics

- System remains stable while \( P(t) > B(t) \)
- Collapse occurs if \( B(t) > P(t) \) persists longer than \( \theta \)
- Transition is nonlinear and may appear sudden

---

##  Empirical Framework

### A. Human Subject Testing

- Metrics: Purpose-in-Life (PIL), PHQ-9, NASA-TLX  
- Subjects: Educators, medics, soldiers, activists  
- Method: Track \( B(t) \), \( P(t) \) over time and infer \( \theta \)

### B. Symbolic Agent Simulation

- Model agents with \( C(t) \), \( B(t) \), \( P(t) \)  
- Introduce contradiction shocks or purpose erosion  
- Observe collapse curve, estimate \( \theta \)

##  Predictions

| Prediction                                 | Observable Indicator                       |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Meaning loss precedes burnout              | Decline in \( P(t) \) before collapse       |
| Purpose reinforcement delays collapse      | Increased \( P(t) \) raises \( \theta \)    |
| Collapse is nonlinear past threshold       | Sudden disengagement or failure             |
| Social support shifts burden/purpose ratio | \( B(t) \downarrow \), \( P(t) \uparrow \)  |

##  Limitations

- \( P(t) \), \( B(t) \) are often self-reported or simulated  
- \( \theta \) is individual-specific and inferred indirectly  
- Group-level collapse modeling not yet implemented  
- Lacks integration with economic/environmental factors

---

##  Suggested Visual Models

- Time plots of \( P(t), B(t), C(t) \) across system lifespan  
- Collapse envelope modeling with and without reinforcement  
- Comparison between high-\( \theta \) vs. low-\( \theta \) systems

## ? Conclusion

The **BPT theorem** reframes collapse as a measurable imbalance between **burden** and **purpose**. Function persists while meaning exceeds load. Failure emerges not from weakness, but from insufficient justification to sustain the strain.
