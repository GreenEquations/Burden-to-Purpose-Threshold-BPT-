SUMMARY

The Burden-to-Purpose Threshold (BPT) theorem proposes that:

Collapse occurs not from too much stress — but from too little meaning to carry it.

When Subjective Burden B(t) exceeds Perceived Purpose P(t) beyond a threshold ?, the system collapses.

Applies to:
- Human burnout, existential collapse
- Belief breakdown in symbolic agents
- Motivational disintegration under contradiction

-------------------------------------------------------

THEOREM STATEMENT

Let:
- C(t): Internal contradiction over time
- B(t): Subjective burden
- P(t): Perceived purpose
- ?: Collapse latency threshold

Collapse Condition:

    ? ?: ? t > ?, B(t) > P(t) ? Collapse(C) = sudden

CORE DEFINITIONS

Symbol     | Meaning
-----------|-------------------------------------------
C(t)       | Internal contradiction (e.g. moral strain)
B(t)       | Subjective burden (emotional/psychological load)
P(t)       | Perceived purpose (meaning, coherence)
?          | Collapse threshold (time until failure tolerance)
Collapse(C)| Sudden system failure: burnout, inversion

-------------------------------------------------------

COLLAPSE MECHANISM

- Contradiction is sustainable *only* while P(t) > B(t)
- Once B(t) > P(t) holds longer than ?, collapse is abrupt
- Collapse is nonlinear — not gradual — like a tipping point
- Real-world forms: resignation, burnout, ideological reversal

-------------------------------------------------------

EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK

A. HUMAN SUBJECT TESTING
- Track Purpose-in-Life (PIL) scores + PHQ-9 / NASA-TLX
- Monitor collapse events in teachers, medics, military, activists
- Use time-series to infer ? (collapse delay)

B. SYMBOLIC AGENT SIMULATION
- Agents modeled with contradiction C(t)
- Adaptive B(t), P(t), and narrative memory
- Inject shocks or meaning loss
- Observe collapse curve and recovery thresholds

-------------------------------------------------------

PREDICTIONS

Prediction                                | Observables
------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Collapse tracks P(t) ? more than B(t) ?   | Meaning loss precedes burnout
Narrative reinforcement delays collapse   | Purpose injections increase ?
Collapse is nonlinear once ? is passed    | Sudden resignation or disengagement
Social factors modulate P(t), B(t)        | Support boosts purpose, strain raises burden

THEORETICAL INTEGRATION

Domain                  | Aligned Concept
------------------------|------------------------------------------------
Existential Psychology  | Frankl: “Meaning buffers suffering”
Cybernetics             | Collapse = dynamic stability breach
Burnout Research        | Adds symbolic + narrative collapse layer
Collapse Theory         | Applies to belief systems, identities
Cognitive Science       | Contradiction ? motivational degradation

-------------------------------------------------------

LIMITATIONS

- P(t) and B(t) are proxy-based (self-report, simulated memory)
- ? is individual-specific and must be inferred
- Collective collapse (institutions, cultures) not yet modeled
- Model does not yet include economic/security buffers

-------------------------------------------------------

VISUAL EXTENSIONS SUGGESTED

- P(t), B(t), C(t) plotted over lifespan of agent
- Collapse envelope modeling: ? under reinforcement vs. stress
- Comparative timelines of high-? vs. low-? systems

CONCLUSION

The BPT theorem reframes psychological collapse not as a failure of strength, but a failure of meaning.

Collapse is not weakness — it’s a rational system response to prolonged contradiction without sufficient justification.

> Purpose — not stamina — is the true buffer against collapse.
