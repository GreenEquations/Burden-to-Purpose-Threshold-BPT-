## I. Summary

This theorem describes when and why systems—whether human or symbolic—experience collapse. It proposes that collapse happens **not just from overload**, but when **subjective burden exceeds the system’s perceived purpose** for long enough.

In both people and artificial agents, **purpose buffers stress**. When meaning drops below burden for too long, breakdown becomes inevitable.

## II. Formal Statement

If there exists a time \( t > \theta \) such that \( B(t) > P(t) \), then collapse occurs:

$$
\exists t > \theta \quad \text{such that} \quad B(t) > P(t) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Collapse}(C) = \text{True}
$$

Where:
- \( C(t) \): Internal contradiction
- \( B(t) \): Subjective burden
- \( P(t) \): Perceived purpose or coherence
- \( \theta \): Collapse latency threshold (varies per system)

## III. Core Concepts

| Symbol       | Meaning                                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `C(t)`       | Contradiction building up inside the system          |
| `B(t)`       | The burden the system feels (stress, overload, etc.) |
| `P(t)`       | The system’s sense of meaning or reason to persist   |
| `θ`          | The max duration of imbalance the system can endure  |
| `Collapse(C)`| A sudden drop in motivation, identity, or coherence  |

## IV. Collapse Mechanism

- **Stable State:** System functions as long as \( P(t) > B(t) \)
- **Instability:** If \( B(t) > P(t) \) continues beyond \( \theta \), breakdown is triggered
- **Outcomes:** Can manifest as burnout, withdrawal, shutdown, or sharp reversal

## V. How to Test It

### A. Human Testing
- Use surveys like Purpose-in-Life (PIL), PHQ-9, NASA-TLX
- Monitor individuals over time to measure purpose vs. burden
- Aim: Predict collapse before it happens by tracking threshold crossing

### B. AI / Simulation Testing
- Model agents with tracked values of burden and purpose
- Simulate rising stress or dropping meaning
- Observe when collapse behaviors emerge under different thresholds

## VI. Predictive Insights

| Scenario                              | Likely Observation                          |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Meaning drops faster than stress rises | Burnout or withdrawal emerges unexpectedly  |
| Injected purpose (coherence cues)     | System lasts longer, higher resilience      |
| Collapse threshold is crossed         | Sudden shift, not gradual decline           |
